# Product Context: GTL Textbook Marketplace

## Problem Statement
University students face significant barriers to accessing affordable educational materials:

### Primary Pain Points
- **High Cost**: New textbooks frequently exceed $200-300USD, creating financial burden
- **Limited Availability**: Used books are difficult to find and verify quality/condition
- **Market Fragmentation**: No centralized platform connecting buyers with graduate sellers
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Demand patterns create shortages during semester peaks
- **Geographic Limitations**: Local listings don't serve students relocating for studies

### Graduate Seller Challenges
- **No Monetization Path**: Surplus textbooks lose value as graduates move on
- **Market Access**: Limited avenues to sell used academic materials
- **Trust Building**: Difficult to establish seller credibility online

### Institutional Challenges
- **Revenue Dependency**: Traditional bookstore models under pressure
- **Inventory Management**: Balancing new book purchases with marketplace listings
- **Student Satisfaction**: Need to support textbook affordability initiatives

## Value Proposition
A one-stop marketplace where Georgia Tech students access affordable textbooks (new and used) while graduates monetize educational investment through peer-to-peer selling.

## Core Solution: Dual-Marketplace Model
1. **New Books**: GTL-curated inventory available at competitive prices
2. **Used Books**: Graduate-sold listings with verified academic tracking
